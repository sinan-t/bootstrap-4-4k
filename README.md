# bootstrap-4.6-4k

## Greetings!
Thanks for checking out this repository. Im pretty new in creating public repositories so feel free to comment out and create issues.

## About this repository
This will help you to add xxl, 2k, 4k to bootstrap `4.6` .
You can either use the compiled versions (`css`) or you can check the `scss` files and use them on your project or create your own `css`

### Compiled versions
You can check `build/css` files for compiled versions.

#### bootstrap-4k.css (recommended)
This version includes the whole 4.6 bootstrap + `xxl`, `2k` and `4k` and its recommended. (unless you want to use cdn for bootstrap and for that you can use other options)

#### bootstrap-grid-4k.css
This is bootstrap-grid + `xxl`, `2k` and `4k` and its recommended.

#### bootstrap-diff-4k.css
This only includes `xxl`, `2k` and `4k` and should be **ONLY** used after you included `bootstrap.css` or `bootstrap-grid.css` in your html file ( good for times when you want to use **cdn** for `bootstrap` or `boostrap-grid` )

### Source versions
check `source/scss` and its pretty much self explanatory ( will add more info later )

#### How to compile
To start using source files and compile them you should have node and npm installed then run:

    npm install
    
This will install `node_modules` and then to compile the source files to get your `css` files you have different options (which i will talk about them more on next updates).
But to compile everything and get all the possible 4k support `css` files you can run:

    npm run build-all-4k
